# Module 14 Challenge Tech Portal

![License Badge](https://badgen.net/static/license/MIT/blue)

## Description

This challenge was based on building a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site was completely built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
